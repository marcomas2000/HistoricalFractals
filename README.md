# HistoricalFractals
This is the outcome of my first encounter with the world of fractals in the late '80s.
Even if at the time I was involved in supposedly far more prestigious projects, I still remember how people reacted when watching these weird pictures coming from a computer.
It takes microseconds these days, but we had to use a lot of trickeries then to produce the pictures in an acceptable amount of time.
I believe that everyone who saw a picture created from the Lyapunov's theory (soon to come here) back then have asked themselves about the "beauty in chaos".
I'll keep updating the collection with what I created at the time.
